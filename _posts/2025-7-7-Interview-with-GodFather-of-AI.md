1. ## **Introduction** {#introduction}

   This week’s assignment focused on writing a short reflection report whose purpose was to allow me to pause and reflect on the history and future of Artificial Intelligence. This was done by engaging in a recent interview with Prof Geoffrey Everest Hinton. He is a 2024 Nobel Peace Prize winner and is considered the Godfather of AI due to his great research in developing multi-layer neural networks and deep learning. I decided to look at a few key talking themes present in the interview, which included the future of work, great risks/threats posed by AI, and future trends in AI development.

2. ## **Tasks to be completed** {#tasks-to-be-completed}

   ### **Future of Work** {#future-of-work}

   With the presence of Artificial Intelligence, the future of work and how it is carried out will be affected. First, in the future, employees will work hand in hand with AI assistants, meaning that they can now accomplish work that would be done by 10 people. This now raises the ceiling of the amount of skill required to hold a job in the future. Prof Hilton also supports the narrative that AI will not take your job, but a human who uses AI will, and he adds that many jobs it will require fewer people and he gives an example of his niece, who has a job in the health service industry, she said that the time taken to respond to letters of complaint, reduced from 25 minutes to 5 minutes through the aid of a chatbot, while this looks awesome at face value, it also means that they need five times fewer of her.
   On the other hand, in the healthcare industry, it is more elastic, where if we could make doctors 5x more efficient, we could get more healthcare at the same price, which is always good. Prof Hilton also states that there are jobs where we could make one more efficient through the use of AI assistants without the loss of jobs, but these jobs are few.

   ### **Great risks/threats posed by AI**

	1. **Cyber Attack Risk**: Prof Hinton explains that there has been an increase in cyber attacks by 1200%, which can be attributed to how easy it has become to come up with phishing attacks through the aid of AI. He also added that there are some reports that by 2030 there will be new kinds of cyber attacks.
	2. **Use of AI to create biological viruses**: Through AI’s ability to assist in genetic engineering that can be used to enhance virus characteristics, and data analysis to predict mutations, this can help to create biological viruses, and can be done by a person who is hell-bent on creating destruction.
	3. **Corrupting elections**: Through the use of targeted ads, elections can be corrupted using AI. It could be used to spread disinformation, target voters with manipulative messaging based on data analysis, and hack voting systems to tamper with results.
	4.  **Creation of echo chambers:** Algorithms used by big tech companies could create echo chambers that could confirm our already existing biases and show us things that make us indignant. Through these echo chambers, we continue to be more and more divided.
	5. **Lethal autonomous weapons(LAWs):** With big countries having more resources than small countries, the presence of lethal autonomous weapons reduces the cost of invasion. With no human oversight, system failures, and malicious use could lead to catastrophic consequences.
	6. **AI-induced joblessness:** Professor Hilton states that for mundane intellectual tasks, AI will replace every one.



   ### **Future trends in AI development.** {#future-trends-in-ai-development.}

   **Wide adoption of AI assistants**: Professor Hilton explains that in the future, there will be a wide adoption of AI assistants, which will revolutionize how work is done in many sectors.

   **The arrival of superintelligence**: Prof Hilton guesses that superintelligence could arrive in 10 to 20 years, and that it will be smarter than us in almost all things. He also adds that if superintelligence is present and we can make it work for us, this could mean we get lots of goods and services for not much effort.

   **AI agents:** The interviewer gave an example of how the future of AI would look by using the example of how they used AI agents to order drinks, where it was able to get their data from Uber Eats and know which drinks they would like, add payment information, add a tip for the driver and soon after the drinks were delivered. This gives a glimpse into the future of AI development.

   **Building of Software with the aid of AI agents:** The interviewer also adds that they were able to build software on Replit by just telling the agents what they wanted to build, and the software was built.

   **Self-improvement of software**: Knowing that AI models were built and trained on code, it could modify its code and change itself, which is scary.


3. ## **Conclusion** {#conclusion}

   Through engaging with this interview, I have gained a deeper understanding of how Artificial Intelligence is now, how it was in the past, and how it could be in the future. It has made me aware of how work could be in the future, the threats or risks posed by Artificial Intelligence, and also a glimpse into the future trends of artificial intelligence. With this interview, I have also gained new respect for the capabilities of AI, and it has also opened my eyes to how it could be used to better productivity in society.
